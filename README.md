# Hexafliptile Screen Saver


## Custom colours

If you don't like any of the colour palettes you can use the following commands to set your own.

    defaults -currentHost write com.doernenburg.hexafliptile palette '("#b02555", "#f58a33", "#b4b740", "#00aa5b", "#00bccd", "#0078bf")' 
    killall cfprefsd

If you are adventurous you can open the screen saver bundle, find a file named `Colors.json`, and permanently add your colour palettes.
